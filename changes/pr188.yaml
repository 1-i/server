enhancement:
  - "Upgrade hasura version to 1.3.3 - [#188](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/server/pull/188)"
If you are using managed database (e.g. Cloud SQL, etc) and upgrading hasura image version from 1.3.1 to 1.3.3, make sure that 
hasura user is the owner of hdb_catalog schema. 
You can find [more details in hasura documentation](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/core/deployment/postgres-requirements.html#notes-for-managed-databases-aws-rds-gcp-cloud-sql-etc).
Moreover, double check if hasura user owns hdb_catalog.insert_event_log function. 
To check functions ownership, run following SQL query `SELECT proname, proowner::regrole FROM pg_proc WHERE pronamespace::regnamespace::text = 'hdb_catalog';`.
To change function ownership, run `ALTER FUNCTION hdb_catalog.insert_event_log OWNER TO hasura;`.
